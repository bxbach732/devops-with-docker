To remove the 3 nginx containers (1 running, 2 stopped), stop the running container and execute this command 3 times:
```shell
docker rm <container id>
```
The current container list is:
```shell
docker ps -a

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
```
After that, remove the nginx image using
```shell
docker rmi nginx
```
The result is:
```shell
docker images 

REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID   CREATED   SIZE
```
