Using the already created web-server image from exercise 1.8, run the container and bind the host port 7777 to the container port 8080:
```shell
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:7777:8080  web-server 
```
After that, open a browser and access <code>localhost:7777</code> and the result is a JSON:
```shell
{
    message: "You connected to the following path: /",
    path: "/"
}
```
