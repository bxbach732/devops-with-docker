Open 2 terminals for each process and create the corresponding image, the first one is for the frontend:
```shell
docker build . -t frontend
```
and the second one is for the backend:
```shell
docker build . -t backend 
```
After that, run each container using:
```shell
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:5000:5000 frontend
```
```shell
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 backend
```
