I deployed the example-backend exercise to render. Firstly, I create a repository for the backend and copy the example-backend code along with the Dockerfile. After that, I log in to render, create a new web service in render, and connect render to the repository. Because render functions as a CI/CD tool, when I push the repository into github, it automatically deploys in render.

The link to my application is: https://bxb-ex16-backend.onrender.com/ping (Since free-tier render automatically sleeps any web-service after 15 minutes of inactivity, please wait for around 10 seconds for it to reboot then you can access it)
