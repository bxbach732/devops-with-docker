First, run the ubuntu container with the required script:
```shell
docker run -d --rm -it --name web ubuntu sh -c 'while true; do echo "Input website:"; read website; echo "Searching.."; sleep 1; curl http://$website; done'
```
After that, access the ubuntu container, install curl and then exit the container:
```shell
docker exec -it web bash   

/# apt-get update
/# apt-get install -y curl
```
Finally, attach the ubuntu container and enter the webite addess:
```shell
docker attach web 

helsinki.fi
Searching..
<html>
<head><title>301 Moved Permanently</title></head>
<body>
<center><h1>301 Moved Permanently</h1></center>
<hr><center>nginx/1.20.1</center>
</body>
</html>
Input website:
```
Another solution is that we update and install curl in the command and don't run it in detached mode:
```shell
docker run --rm -it --name web ubuntu sh -c 'apt-get update; apt-get install -y curl;while true; do echo "Input website:"; read website; echo "Searching.."; sleep 1; curl http://$website; done' 
```
After this, enter the site's address and it will work as above.
