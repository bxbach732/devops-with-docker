I changed the 2 URLs inside the 2 Dockerfile:
```shell
ENV REQUEST_ORIGIN=http://localhost
```
```shell
ENV REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost/api/
```
Also, I added the build key to the backend and frontend service to build the 2 images based on the Dockerfiles when I use <code>docker compose up</code>
