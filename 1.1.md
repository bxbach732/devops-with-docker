First, pull the nginx image:
```shell
docker pull nginx
```
and the nginx image is downloaded:
```shell
docker images

REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED      SIZE
nginx        latest    eb4a57159180   2 days ago   187MB
```
Start 3 nginx containers in detached mode by running this command 3 times:
```shell
docker run -d nginx
```
The container list:
```shell
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS              PORTS     NAMES
ab863568320e   nginx     "/docker-entrypoint.…"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute   80/tcp    zen_newton
3bee1b86e55c   nginx     "/docker-entrypoint.…"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute   80/tcp    jolly_mccarthy
9fd381040ed1   nginx     "/docker-entrypoint.…"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute   80/tcp    condescending_proskuriakova
```
Now stop 2 of those containers using
```shell
docker stop <container id>
```
The result is:
```shell
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS                          PORTS     NAMES
